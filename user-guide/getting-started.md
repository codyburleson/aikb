# User Getting Started

## 1. Install the Gemini CLI

- Install the [Gemini command line interface (CLI)](https://geminicli.com/)
- If you are a developer using VS Code you can optionally select to install the VS Code extension for integration with your IDE
- Type `gemini` in your terminal to launch the CLI
- Login (I chose with Google for now; other options are Gemini API key and Vertex AI)
